\arguments{
\item{exp}{expression data (if merge==T,exp need a colum to contain gene symbol).}

\item{group}{group is the vector which indicate the sample's group}

\item{compared}{compared used to identify which group vs which group (usually <conventional> - <control>). also use for multi group condition.}

\item{normalize}{if the array expression data need to normalized between different sample}

\item{log2}{if the expression data need to be convert to log2}

\item{merge}{if expression data contain same gene symol, you can use it to merge them}

\item{symbol}{accordance with "merge==T", specific the colum name of symbol}

\item{rna.count}{used to execute rna-seq}

\item{p.name}{the colname of pvalue}

\item{fc.name}{the colname of fold change}

\item{p.value}{the threshold of pvalue}

\item{fc.value}{the threshold of fold change}

\item{file.name}{if need to write a txt file to save the deg result, you can assign a file name}
}
\value{
deg result merged with normalized expression data
}
